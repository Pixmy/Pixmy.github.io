Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treat as medically appropriate.</p><p>Verzenio can cause <strong style='color: #00abc7'>fetal harm</strong> when administered to a pregnant woman based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action. In animal reproduction studies, administration of abemaciclib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused teratogenicity and decreased fetal weight at maternal exposures that were similar to the human clinical exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Verzenio and for at least 3&nbsp;weeks after the last dose. There are no data on the presence of Verzenio in human milk or its effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Advise lactating women not to breastfeed during Verzenio treatment and for at least 3&nbsp;weeks after the last dose because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants. Based on findings in animals, Verzenio may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential.</p><p>The <strong style='color: #00abc7'>most common adverse reactions (all grades, &ge;10%)</strong> observed in <strong style='color: #00abc7'>MONARCH&nbsp;3 for Verzenio plus anastrozole or letrozole</strong> and <strong style='color: #00abc7'>&ge;2% higher than placebo plus anastrozole or letrozole vs placebo plus anastrozole or letrozole</strong> were diarrhea (81% vs 30%), neutropenia (41% vs 2%), fatigue (40% vs 32%), infections (39% vs 29%), nausea (39% vs 20%), abdominal pain (29% vs 12%), vomiting (28% vs 12%), anemia (28% vs 5%), alopecia (27% vs 11%), decreased appetite (24% vs 9%), leukopenia (21% vs 2%), creatinine increased (19% vs 4%), constipation (16% vs 12%), ALT increased (16% vs 7%), AST increased (15% vs 7%), rash (14% vs 5%), pruritus (13% vs 9%), cough (13% vs 9%), dyspnea (12% vs 6%), dizziness (11% vs 9%), weight decreased (10% vs 3%), influenza-like illness (10% vs 8%), and thrombocytopenia (10% vs 2%).</p><p>The <strong style='color: #00abc7'>most common adverse reactions (all grades, &ge;10%)</strong> observed in <strong style='color: #00abc7'>MONARCH 2 for Verzenio plus fulvestrant and &ge;2% higher than placebo plus fulvestrant vs placebo plus fulvestrant</strong> were diarrhea (86% vs 25%), neutropenia (46% vs 4%), fatigue (46% vs 32%), nausea (45% vs 23%), infections (43% vs 25%), abdominal pain (35% vs 16%), anemia (29% vs 4%), leukopenia (28% vs 2%), decreased appetite (27% vs 12%), vomiting (26% vs 10%), headache (20% vs 15%), dysgeusia (18% vs 3%), thrombocytopenia (16% vs 3%), alopecia (16% vs 2%), stomatitis (15% vs 10%), ALT increased (13% vs 5%), pruritus (13% vs 6%), cough (13% vs 11%), dizziness (12% vs 6%), AST increased (12% vs 7%), peripheral edema (12% vs 7%), creatinine increased (12% vs &lt;1%), rash (11% vs 4%), pyrexia (11% vs 6%), and weight decreased (10% vs 2%).</p><p>The <strong style='color: #00abc7'>most common adverse reactions (all grades, &ge;10%)</strong> observed in <strong style='color: #00abc7'>MONARCH 1</strong> with Verzenio were diarrhea (90%), fatigue (65%), nausea (64%), decreased appetite (45%), abdominal pain (39%), neutropenia (37%), vomiting (35%), infections (31%), anemia (25%), thrombocytopenia (20%), headache (20%), cough (19%), leukopenia (17%), constipation (17%), arthralgia (15%), dry mouth (14%), weight decreased (14%), stomatitis (14%), creatinine increased (13%), alopecia (12%), dysgeusia (12%), pyrexia (11%), dizziness (11%), and dehydration (10%). </p><p>The <strong style='color: #00abc7'>most frequently reported &ge;5% Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions</strong> that occurred in the Verzenio arm vs the placebo arm of <strong style='color: #00abc7'>MONARCH&nbsp;3</strong> were neutropenia (22% vs 2%), diarrhea (9% vs 1%), leukopenia (8% vs &lt;1%), ALT increased (7% vs 2%), and anemia (6% vs 1%).</p><p>The <strong style='color: #00abc7'>most frequently reported &ge;5% Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions</strong> that occurred in the Verzenio arm vs the placebo arm of <strong style='color: #00abc7'>MONARCH 2</strong> were neutropenia (27% vs 2%), diarrhea (13% vs &lt;1%), leukopenia (9% vs 0%), anemia (7% vs 1%), and infections (6% vs 3%).</p><p>The <strong style='color: #00abc7'>most frequently reported &ge;5% Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions</strong> from <strong style='color: #00abc7'>MONARCH 1</strong> with Verzenio were neutropenia (24%), diarrhea (20%), fatigue (13%), infections (7%), leukopenia (6%), anemia (5%), and nausea (5%).</p><p><strong style='color: #00abc7'>Lab abnormalities (all grades;

Avoid concomitant use of the strong CYP3A&nbsp;inhibitor ketoconazole. Ketoconazole is predicted to increase the AUC of abemaciclib by up to 16-fold. In patients with recommended starting doses of 200&nbsp;mg twice&nbsp;daily or 150&nbsp;mg twice&nbsp;daily, reduce the Verzenio dose to 100&nbsp;mg twice&nbsp;daily with concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors other than ketoconazole. In patients who have had a dose reduction to 100&nbsp;mg twice&nbsp;daily due to adverse reactions, further reduce the Verzenio dose to 50&nbsp;mg twice daily with concomitant use of strong CYP3A&nbsp;inhibitors. If a patient taking Verzenio discontinues a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increase the Verzenio dose (after 3 to 5&nbsp;half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose that was used before starting the inhibitor. With concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors, monitor for adverse reactions and consider reducing the Verzenio dose in 50mg decrements. Patients should avoid grapefruit products. </p><p><strong style='color: #00abc7'>Avoid concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A inducers and consider alternative agents.</strong> Coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A&nbsp;inducers decreased the plasma concentrations of abemaciclib plus its active metabolites and may lead to reduced activity. </p><p><strong style='color: #00abc7'>With severe hepatic impairment</strong> (Child-Pugh Class C), reduce the Verzenio dosing frequency to once daily.

In MONARCH 2, for patients receiving Verzenio plus fulvestrant with Grade &ge;3 increases in ALT or AST, median time to onset was 57 and 185&nbsp;days, respectively, and median time to resolution to Grade &lt;3 was 14 and 13&nbsp;days, respectively. </p><p>For assessment of potential <strong style='color: #00abc7'>hepatotoxicity</strong>, monitor liver function tests (LFTs) prior to the start of Verzenio therapy, every 2&nbsp;weeks for the first 2&nbsp;months, monthly for the next 2&nbsp;months, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, dose discontinuation, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop persistent or recurrent Grade&nbsp;2, or Grade&nbsp;3 or 4, hepatic transaminase elevation.</p><p><strong style='color: #00abc7'>Venous thromboembolic events</strong> were reported in 5% of patients treated with Verzenio plus an aromatase inhibitor as compared to 0.6% of patients treated with an aromatase inhibitor plus placebo in MONARCH&nbsp;3. Venous thromboembolic events were reported in 5% of patients treated with Verzenio plus fulvestrant in MONARCH&nbsp;2 as compared to 0.9% of patients treated with fulvestrant plus placebo. Venous thromboembolic events included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pelvic venous thrombosis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, subclavian and axillary vein thrombosis, and inferior vena cava thrombosis. Across the clinical development program, deaths due to venous thromboembolism have been reported. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treat as medically appropriate.</p><p>Verzenio can cause <strong style='color: #00abc7'>fetal harm</strong> when administered to a pregnant woman based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action. In animal reproduction studies, administration of abemaciclib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused teratogenicity and decreased fetal weight at maternal exposures that were similar to the human clinical exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Verzenio and for at least 3&nbsp;weeks after the last dose. There are no data on the presence of Verzenio in human milk or its effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Advise lactating women not to breastfeed during Verzenio treatment and for at least 3&nbsp;weeks after the last dose because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants. Based on findings in animals, Verzenio may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential.</p><p>The <strong style='color: #00abc7'>most common adverse reactions (all grades, &ge;10%)</strong> observed in <strong style='color: #00abc7'>MONARCH&nbsp;3 for Verzenio plus anastrozole or letrozole</strong> and <strong style='color: #00abc7'>&ge;2% higher than placebo plus anastrozole or letrozole vs placebo plus anastrozole or letrozole</strong> were diarrhea (81% vs 30%), neutropenia (41% vs 2%), fatigue (40% vs 32%), infections (39% vs 29%), nausea (39% vs 20%), abdominal pain (29% vs 12%), vomiting (28% vs 12%), anemia (28% vs 5%), alopecia (27% vs 11%), decreased appetite (24% vs 9%), leukopenia (21% vs 2%), creatinine increased (19% vs 4%), constipation (16% vs 12%), ALT increased (16% vs 7%), AST increased (15% vs 7%), rash (14% vs 5%), pruritus (13% vs 9%), cough (13% vs 9%), dyspnea (12% vs 6%), dizziness (11% vs 9%), weight decreased (10% vs 3%), influenza-like illness (10% vs 8%), and thrombocytopenia (10% vs 2%).</p><p>The <strong style='color: #00abc7'>most common adverse reactions (all grades, &ge;10%)</strong> observed in <strong style='color: #00abc7'>MONARCH 2 for Verzenio plus fulvestrant and &ge;2% higher than placebo plus fulvestrant vs placebo plus fulvestrant</strong> were diarrhea (86% vs 25%), neutropenia (46% vs 4%), fatigue (46% vs 32%), nausea (45% vs 23%), infections (43% vs 25%), abdominal pain (35% vs 16%), anemia (29% vs 4%), leukopenia (28% vs 2%), decreased appetite (27% vs 12%), vomiting (26% vs 10%), headache (20% vs 15%), dysgeusia (18% vs 3%), thrombocytopenia (16% vs 3%), alopecia (16% vs 2%), stomatitis (15% vs 10%), ALT increased (13% vs 5%), pruritus (13% vs 6%), cough (13% vs 11%), dizziness (12% vs 6%), AST increased (12% vs 7%), peripheral edema (12% vs 7%), creatinine increased (12% vs &lt;1%), rash (11% vs 4%), pyrexia (11% vs 6%), and weight decreased (10% vs 2%).</p><p>The <strong style='color: #00abc7'>most common adverse reactions (all grades, &ge;10%)</strong> observed in <strong style='color: #00abc7'>MONARCH 1</strong> with Verzenio were diarrhea (90%), fatigue (65%), nausea (64%), decreased appetite (45%), abdominal pain (39%), neutropenia (37%), vomiting (35%), infections (31%), anemia (25%), thrombocytopenia (20%), headache (20%), cough (19%), leukopenia (17%), constipation (17%), arthralgia (15%), dry mouth (14%), weight decreased (14%), stomatitis (14%), creatinine increased (13%), alopecia (12%), dysgeusia (12%), pyrexia (11%), dizziness (11%), and dehydration (10%). </p><p>The <strong style='color: #00abc7'>most frequently reported &ge;5% Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions</strong> that occurred in the Verzenio arm vs the placebo arm of <strong style='color: #00abc7'>MONARCH&nbsp;3</strong> were neutropenia (22% vs 2%), diarrhea (9% vs 1%), leukopenia (8% vs &lt;1%), ALT increased (7% vs 2%), and anemia (6% vs 1%).</p><p>The <strong style='color: #00abc7'>most frequently reported &ge;5% Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions</strong> that occurred in the Verzenio arm vs the placebo arm of <strong style='color: #00abc7'>MONARCH 2</strong> were neutropenia (27% vs 2%), diarrhea (13% vs &lt;1%), leukopenia (9% vs 0%), anemia (7% vs 1%), and infections (6% vs 3%).</p><p>The <strong style='color: #00abc7'>most frequently reported &ge;5% Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions</strong> from <strong style='color: #00abc7'>MONARCH 1</strong> with Verzenio were neutropenia (24%), diarrhea (20%), fatigue (13%), infections (7%), leukopenia (6%), anemia (5%), and nausea (5%).</p><p><strong style='color: #00abc7'>Lab abnormalities (all grades;

Avoid concomitant use of the strong CYP3A&nbsp;inhibitor ketoconazole. Ketoconazole is predicted to increase the AUC of abemaciclib by up to 16-fold. In patients with recommended starting doses of 200&nbsp;mg twice&nbsp;daily or 150&nbsp;mg twice&nbsp;daily, reduce the Verzenio dose to 100&nbsp;mg twice&nbsp;daily with concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors other than ketoconazole. In patients who have had a dose reduction to 100&nbsp;mg twice&nbsp;daily due to adverse reactions, further reduce the Verzenio dose to 50&nbsp;mg twice daily with concomitant use of strong CYP3A&nbsp;inhibitors. If a patient taking Verzenio discontinues a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increase the Verzenio dose (after 3 to 5&nbsp;half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose that was used before starting the inhibitor. With concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors, monitor for adverse reactions and consider reducing the Verzenio dose in 50mg decrements. Patients should avoid grapefruit products. </p><p><strong style='color: #00abc7'>Avoid concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A inducers and consider alternative agents.</strong>  Coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A&nbsp;inducers decreased the plasma concentrations of abemaciclib plus its active metabolites and may lead to reduced activity. </p><p><strong style='color: #00abc7'>With severe hepatic impairment</strong> (Child-Pugh Class C), reduce the Verzenio dosing frequency to once daily.

Episodes of diarrhea have been associated with dehydration and infection. </p><p>Diarrhea incidence was greatest during the first month of Verzenio dosing. In MONARCH&nbsp;3, the median time to onset of the first diarrhea event was 8&nbsp;days, and the median duration of diarrhea for Grades&nbsp;2 and 3 were 11&nbsp;and 8&nbsp;days, respectively. In MONARCH&nbsp;2, the median time to onset of the first diarrhea event was 6&nbsp;days, and the median duration of diarrhea for Grades&nbsp;2 and 3 were 9&nbsp;days and 6&nbsp;days, respectively. In MONARCH&nbsp;3, 19% of patients with diarrhea required a dose omission and 13% required a dose reduction. In MONARCH&nbsp;2, 22% of patients with diarrhea required a dose omission and 22% required a dose reduction. The time to onset and resolution for diarrhea were similar across MONARCH&nbsp;3, MONARCH&nbsp;2, and MONARCH&nbsp;1.</p><p>Instruct patients that at the first sign of loose stools, they should start antidiarrheal therapy such as loperamide, increase oral fluids, and notify their healthcare provider for further instructions and appropriate follow-up. For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, or diarrhea that requires hospitalization, discontinue Verzenio until toxicity resolves to &le;Grade 1, and then resume Verzenio at the next lower dose.</p><p><strong style='color: #00abc7'>Neutropenia</strong> occurred in 41% of patients receiving Verzenio plus an aromatase inhibitor in MONARCH&nbsp;3, 46% of patients receiving Verzenio plus fulvestrant in MONARCH&nbsp;2 and 37% of patients receiving Verzenio alone in MONARCH 1. A Grade &ge;3 decrease in neutrophil count (based on laboratory findings) occurred in 22% of patients receiving Verzenio plus an aromatase inhibitor in MONARCH&nbsp;3, 32% of patients receiving Verzenio plus fulvestrant in MONARCH 2 and in 27% of patients receiving Verzenio alone in MONARCH 1. In MONARCH&nbsp;3, the median time to first episode of Grade &ge;3 neutropenia was 33 days, and in MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 1, was 29 days. In MONARCH&nbsp;3, median duration of Grade &ge;3 neutropenia was 11 days, and for MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 1 was 15 days.</p><p>Monitor complete blood counts prior to the start of Verzenio therapy, every 2&nbsp;weeks for the first 2&nbsp;months, monthly for the next 2&nbsp;months, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop Grade&nbsp;3 or 4 neutropenia.</p><p>Febrile neutropenia has been reported in &lt;1% of patients exposed to Verzenio in the MONARCH studies. Two deaths due to neutropenic sepsis were observed in MONARCH&nbsp;2.

Venous thromboembolic events included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pelvic venous thrombosis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, subclavian and axillary vein thrombosis, and inferior vena cava thrombosis. Across the clinical development program, deaths due to venous thromboembolism have been reported. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treat as medically appropriate.</p><p>Verzenio can cause <strong style='color: #00abc7'>fetal harm</strong> when administered to a pregnant woman based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action. In animal reproduction studies, administration of abemaciclib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused teratogenicity and decreased fetal weight at maternal exposures that were similar to the human clinical exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Verzenio and for at least 3&nbsp;weeks after the last dose. There are no data on the presence of Verzenio in human milk or its effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Advise lactating women not to breastfeed during Verzenio treatment and for at least 3&nbsp;weeks after the last dose because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants. Based on findings in animals, Verzenio may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential.</p><p>The <strong style='color: #00abc7'>most common adverse reactions (all grades, &ge;10%)</strong> observed in <strong style='color: #00abc7'>MONARCH&nbsp;3 for Verzenio plus anastrozole or letrozole</strong> and <strong style='color: #00abc7'>&ge;2% higher than placebo plus anastrozole or letrozole vs placebo plus anastrozole or letrozole</strong> were diarrhea (81% vs 30%), neutropenia (41% vs 2%), fatigue (40% vs 32%), infections (39% vs 29%), nausea (39% vs 20%), abdominal pain (29% vs 12%), vomiting (28% vs 12%), anemia (28% vs 5%), alopecia (27% vs 11%), decreased appetite (24% vs 9%), leukopenia (21% vs 2%), creatinine increased (19% vs 4%), constipation (16% vs 12%), ALT increased (16% vs 7%), AST increased (15% vs 7%), rash (14% vs 5%), pruritus (13% vs 9%), cough (13% vs 9%), dyspnea (12% vs 6%), dizziness (11% vs 9%), weight decreased (10% vs 3%), influenza-like illness (10% vs 8%), and thrombocytopenia (10% vs 2%).</p><p>The <strong style='color: #00abc7'>most common adverse reactions (all grades, &ge;10%)</strong> observed in <strong style='color: #00abc7'>MONARCH 2 for Verzenio plus fulvestrant and &ge;2% higher than placebo plus fulvestrant vs placebo plus fulvestrant</strong> were diarrhea (86% vs 25%), neutropenia (46% vs 4%), fatigue (46% vs 32%), nausea (45% vs 23%), infections (43% vs 25%), abdominal pain (35% vs 16%), anemia (29% vs 4%), leukopenia (28% vs 2%), decreased appetite (27% vs 12%), vomiting (26% vs 10%), headache (20% vs 15%), dysgeusia (18% vs 3%), thrombocytopenia (16% vs 3%), alopecia (16% vs 2%), stomatitis (15% vs 10%), ALT increased (13% vs 5%), pruritus (13% vs 6%), cough (13% vs 11%), dizziness (12% vs 6%), AST increased (12% vs 7%), peripheral edema (12% vs 7%), creatinine increased (12% vs &lt;1%), rash (11% vs 4%), pyrexia (11% vs 6%), and weight decreased (10% vs 2%).</p><p>The <strong style='color: #00abc7'>most common adverse reactions (all grades, &ge;10%)</strong> observed in <strong style='color: #00abc7'>MONARCH 1</strong> with Verzenio were diarrhea (90%), fatigue (65%), nausea (64%), decreased appetite (45%), abdominal pain (39%), neutropenia (37%), vomiting (35%), infections (31%), anemia (25%), thrombocytopenia (20%), headache (20%), cough (19%), leukopenia (17%), constipation (17%), arthralgia (15%), dry mouth (14%), weight decreased (14%), stomatitis (14%), creatinine increased (13%), alopecia (12%), dysgeusia (12%), pyrexia (11%), dizziness (11%), and dehydration (10%). </p><p>The <strong style='color: #00abc7'>most frequently reported &ge;5% Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions</strong> that occurred in the Verzenio arm vs the placebo arm of <strong style='color: #00abc7'>MONARCH&nbsp;3</strong> were neutropenia (22% vs 2%), diarrhea (9% vs 1%), leukopenia (8% vs &lt;1%), ALT increased (7% vs 2%), and anemia (6% vs 1%).</p><p>The <strong style='color: #00abc7'>most frequently reported &ge;5% Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions</strong> that occurred in the Verzenio arm vs the placebo arm of <strong style='color: #00abc7'>MONARCH 2</strong> were neutropenia (27% vs 2%), diarrhea (13% vs &lt;1%), leukopenia (9% vs 0%), anemia (7% vs 1%), and infections (6% vs 3%).</p><p>The <strong style='color: #00abc7'>most frequently reported &ge;5% Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions</strong> from <strong style='color: #00abc7'>MONARCH 1</strong> with Verzenio were neutropenia (24%), diarrhea (20%), fatigue (13%), infections (7%), leukopenia (6%), anemia (5%), and nausea (5%).</p><p><strong style='color: #00abc7'>Lab abnormalities (all grades;

Avoid concomitant use of the strong CYP3A&nbsp;inhibitor ketoconazole. Ketoconazole is predicted to increase the AUC of abemaciclib by up to 16-fold. In patients with recommended starting doses of 200&nbsp;mg twice&nbsp;daily or 150&nbsp;mg twice&nbsp;daily, reduce the Verzenio dose to 100&nbsp;mg twice&nbsp;daily with concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors other than ketoconazole. In patients who have had a dose reduction to 100&nbsp;mg twice&nbsp;daily due to adverse reactions, further reduce the Verzenio dose to 50&nbsp;mg twice daily with concomitant use of strong CYP3A&nbsp;inhibitors. If a patient taking Verzenio discontinues a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increase the Verzenio dose (after 3 to 5&nbsp;half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose that was used before starting the inhibitor. With concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors, monitor for adverse reactions and consider reducing the Verzenio dose in 50mg decrements. Patients should avoid grapefruit products. </p><p><strong style='color: #00abc7'>Avoid concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A inducers and consider alternative agents.</strong>  Coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A&nbsp;inducers decreased the plasma concentrations of abemaciclib plus its active metabolites and may lead to reduced activity. </p><p><strong style='color: #00abc7'>With severe hepatic impairment</strong> (Child-Pugh Class C), reduce the Verzenio dosing frequency to once daily.
